Tricks:

* Use layers and layer sorting
* On drag-and-drop: `OnMouseDown` and `OnMouseUp` are only effective for an object with a collider or a GUIText object. 
* Create prefab: drag a GameObject to Project window
* Add a collider as terrain to enable gravity (one of the two objects must have rigidbody component)
* Drag console to project view
