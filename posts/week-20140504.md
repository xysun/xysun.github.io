### [Dan Grossman](http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse341/13sp/#lectures)

* Syntax, semantics, idioms, libraries, tools
* records: `#field_name record_name`
* tuples are syntax sugers of records (field_name = 1, 2, 3...)
* `datatype` bindings: `Constant of int | Add of expr * expr`
* pattern matching: `case x of =>`
* one-of (Option); each-of (Records)
* type synonym: `type name = t`. `type card = suit * rank`
* polymorphic datatype: `datatype 'a option = NONE | SOME of 'a`
* `val p = e`. `p` --> patterns
* `fun f p = e`
* `exception`, `raise`
* `e1 handle exn => e2`
* tail optimization: remove caller from call stack
* the wrath of premature optimization

### [Foundation by Isaac Asimov](http://www.amazon.com/Foundation-Novels-Isaac-Asimov/dp/0553293354/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1399198338&sr=8-1&keywords=asimov+foundation)

(Notes generated by my little [Kindle script](https://gist.github.com/xysun/9837480)

* If you're born in a cubicle and grow up in a corridor, and work in a cell, and vacation in a crowded sun-room, then coming up into the open with nothing but sky over you might just give you a nervous breakdown. 
* I don't care an electron
* And when Onum Barr stepped into his little garden early the next morning, he found a box at his feet. It contained provisions, concentrated provisions such as one would find aboard ship, and alien in taste and preparation. But they were good, and lasted long. 
* The whole war is a battle between those two systems, between the Empire and the Foundation; between the big and the little.

### [Max sub-array problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_subarray_problem)

    
    def max_sub_array(l):
        max_ending_here = max_so_far = l[0]
        begin = begin_temp = end = l[0]

        for i in range(1, len(l)):
            if l[i] > l[i] + max_ending_here:
                max_ending_here = l[i]
                begin_temp = i
            else:
                max_ending_here += l[i]

            if max_ending_here >= max_so_far:
                max_so_far = max_ending_here
                begin = begin_temp
                end = i
        
        return max_so_far, begin, end
