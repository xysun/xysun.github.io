### [Surely You're joking, Mr. Feynman!](http://www.amazon.com/Surely-Feynman-Adventures-Curious-Character/dp/0393316041)

> Learn what the rest of the world is like. The variety is worthwhile.

> "I could do that, but I won't" -- which is just another way of saying that you can't. 

> You don't have to be responsible for the world that you're in.

> You have no responsibility to live up to what other people think you ought to accomplish.

### [Dan Grossman](http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse341/13sp/videos/unit1/)

* expression: syntax, type-checking, evaluate
* REPL: Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop; do not type `use` without restarting REPL
* syntax: 
    * negation: `~5`
    * division: `div`
* after expression evaluated, the expression producing the result is irrelevant --> do not reuse `use` in sml
* access pair/tuple: `#1 e`
* naming: 
    * `pair` <--> `pr`

### [Learn C the hard way](http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/)

* [switch statement](http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex13.html): 
    * `return 1` --> tell OS there's an error
    * only integers allowed (eg. char)
* [use functions](http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex14.html)
    * forward declaration: use function before defining them
* [pointers](http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex15.html)

### Miscellaneous

* I wrote a small [utility](https://gist.github.com/xysun/9837480) to manage my "My Clippings.txt" from Kindle. This script will create a separate note for each book. 

* [gist](http://defunkt.io/gist/) is an awesome command line tool for gist. 

* use `rlwrap sml` to enable history rollback through arrow keys
