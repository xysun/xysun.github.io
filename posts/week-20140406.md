### Dan Grossman

* functions over lists are usually recursive: empty list; non-empty list (`hd`, `tl`) 
* let expression: `let...in...end`
* Do a recursive computation, store in (local binding)
* Option: `isSome`, `valOf`
* Bool comparisons: `andalso`, `orelse`, `not`
* `real` is not an equality type (subject to round errors)
* no mutation --> no need to worry about alias or copies --> implementation more efficient & better security

### [Brandon Rhodes Pycon talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYlnfvKVDoM)

* [Gustavo Duarte -- what your computer does while you wait](http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog/post/what-your-computer-does-while-you-wait/)
* [Dan Luu -- how misaligning data can increase performance 12x](http://danluu.com/3c-conflict/)
* Python store general purpose data structures (eg. tuple) as array of addresses
* `append` on a list adds extra spaces -- amortization
* list is fast for tail operations: `append`, `pop`. Not `pop(0)`, `insert(0)`
* `dict` is an array with keys stored at integer indexes according to hash value: 
    * hash -- key address -- value address
    * PyCon 2010 "The mighty dictionary"
    * can build compound keys with tuple
* set: dictionary with no keys
* `deque`, `heapq`
* 2013 PyCon, the clean architecture in Python
